# AI Image Generator

This project uses the OpenAI API https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/images/introduction. 

The user has the ability to generate an image by describing it in words.

Note that the image is fresh and created by the AI from scratch, not searched from the internet.

This project can be further improved by using React for a dynamic user interface and then add a spinner when waiting for the API result.

## Lessons Learned:

AI is another tool that can help developers work efficiently.

With an increasing number of different AI that developers can use, I think the future will revolve around them and how developers can use them effectively.
